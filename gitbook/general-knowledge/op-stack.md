# üß∞ OP Stack

The OP Stack is like the ultimate toolkit for L2 blockchain creation, masterfully crafted by the Optimism Collective. Think of it as a curated set of software tools üß∞, each handpicked and maintained by the experts at the Optimism Collective. Some tools lay the foundation, while others seamlessly integrate as modules üß©.

In essence, the OP Stack brings the concept of modular blockchains to life üí°. It's all about providing developers with a ready-made platform, eliminating the need to start entirely from square one. It's innovation made easy! ‚ú®

#### **Why are developers choosing OP Stack?**

In essence, the OP Stack brings the concept of modular blockchains to life üí°. It's all about providing developers with a ready-made platform, eliminating the need to start entirely from square one.

In the OP stack, there are three primary layers:

1. **Consensus** ü§ù: This layer encompasses **Data Availability and Derivation**.
2. **Execution** üîÑ
3. **Settlement** üíº

Each of these layers functions as an API, offering flexibility and customization. As long as you align with the APIs, the sky's the limit for what you can build!

#### Let's break down OP Stack further:

Here I will provide a short explanation of each layer accompanied by a mathematical representation, for better learning.

*   **Data Availability Layer**: Think of this as a storage unit, holding an array of bytes.

    ```jsx

    type DA = bytes[]

    ```
*   **Derivation Function**: This function takes in the previous state and the data from the availability layer. Depending on the input, it either produces a payload or returns nothing.

    ```jsx

    derive(previous State, DA) ‚áí {Payload or null}

    ```
*   **Execution Function**: Acting on the payload generated by the derivation function, this function processes the previous state to produce a new state.

    ```jsx
    execute(previous State, payload) ‚áí boolean (0 or 1)

    ```
*   **Validity Function**: The final check! This function ensures the new state is valid, considering all other functions.

    ```jsx

    valid(previous State, new State, DA, derive, execute)

    ```

The OP Stack marks the initial stage in the rapid growth of highly compatible Layer-2s and Layer-3s, collectively referred to as **op-chains** within Optimism's ecosystem.

As we look ahead, the boundaries between op-chains will dissolve, giving rise to a unified **Superchain.** This Superchain will seamlessly integrate multiple op-chains, allowing for the shared utilization of collective resources.
