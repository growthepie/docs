## Concise Summary

The OP Stack is like the ultimate toolkit for L2 blockchain creation, masterfully crafted by the Optimism Collective. Think of it as a curated set of software tools üß∞, each handpicked and maintained by the experts at the Optimism Collective. Some tools lay the foundation, while others seamlessly integrate as modules üß©.

In essence, the OP Stack brings the concept of modular blockchains to life üí°. It's all about providing developers with a ready-made platform, eliminating the need to start entirely from square one. It's innovation made easy! ‚ú®

#### **Why are developers choosing OP Stack?**

In essence, the OP Stack brings the concept of modular blockchains to life üí°. It's all about providing developers with a ready-made platform, eliminating the need to start entirely from square one.

In the OP stack, there are three primary layers:

1. **Consensus** ü§ù: This layer encompasses **Data Availability and Derivation**.
2. **Execution** üîÑ
3. **Settlement** üíº

Each of these layers functions as an API, offering flexibility and customization. As long as you align with the APIs, the sky's the limit for what you can build!

#### Let's break down OP Stack further:

Here I will provide a short explanation of each layer accompanied by a mathematical representation, for better learning.

*   **Data Availability Layer**: Think of this as a storage unit, holding an array of bytes.

    ```jsx

    type DA = bytes[]

    ```
*   **Derivation Function**: This function takes in the previous state and the data from the availability layer. Depending on the input, it either produces a payload or returns nothing.

    ```jsx

    derive(previous State, DA) ‚áí {Payload or null}

    ```
*   **Execution Function**: Acting on the payload generated by the derivation function, this function processes the previous state to produce a new state.

    ```jsx
    execute(previous State, payload) ‚áí boolean (0 or 1)

    ```
*   **Validity Function**: The final check! This function ensures the new state is valid, considering all other functions.

    ```jsx

    valid(previous State, new State, DA, derive, execute)

    ```

The OP Stack marks the initial stage in the rapid growth of highly compatible Layer-2s and Layer-3s, collectively referred to as **op-chains** within Optimism's ecosystem.

As we look ahead, the boundaries between op-chains will dissolve, giving rise to a unified **Superchain.** This Superchain will seamlessly integrate multiple op-chains, allowing for the shared utilization of collective resources.

_Here you get quick access to the most important pieces of docs and articles, curated for devs._

***

This guide is meant to help you kick off your OP Stack journey by taking you through the process of spinning up your very own OP Stack chain on the Ethereum Goerli testnet.&#x20;

**Use the material to**

* Perform tests and prepare for the superchain.
* Modify it to adapt it to your own needs.

Modifying your chain with significantly different parameters may make it incompatible with the superchain in the future
