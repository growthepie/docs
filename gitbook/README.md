# Introduction

Welcome to **growthepie**! We are your go-to resource for up-to-date metrics, analysis, and insights on Ethereum Layer 2 projects. As the Ethereum ecosystem expands and evolves, Layer 2 solutions are becoming increasingly critical in scaling the network and ensuring it remains efficient and secure. growthepie is dedicated to helping you navigate the complex world of Layer 2 projects, empowering you to make informed decisions about which technologies and projects to invest in, support, or simply keep an eye on.

### What is an Ethereum Layer 2?

Ethereum Layer 2 refers to a suite of scaling solutions built on top of the Ethereum blockchain (Layer 1) to improve its scalability, efficiency, and throughput. These solutions typically involve offloading some of the computation and data storage from the main chain to secondary networks, while still maintaining a high level of security and decentralization.

Some popular Layer 2 scaling solutions include:

1. **Optimistic Rollups**: These solutions bundle multiple transactions into a single on-chain transaction, reducing the amount of data stored on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. **ZK-Rollups**: Similar to Optimistic Rollups, ZK-Rollups use zero-knowledge proofs to validate transactions off-chain, further improving scalability and privacy.
3. **State Channels**: State Channels allow users to transact off-chain and only settle the net result on-chain, reducing the burden on the Ethereum network.
4. **Plasma**: Plasma is a framework for building scalable and secure child chains that are tethered to the Ethereum main chain.

At growthepie we focus on analyzing optimistic and zk-rollups because they deliver the best trade-offs in terms of scalability, decentralization, and security.

### Why growthepie?

The Ethereum Layer 2 landscape is rapidly evolving, with new projects and technologies emerging every day. It can be challenging to keep up with the latest developments and to understand how these projects compare to one another. growthepie is designed to help you cut through the noise and provide you with the information you need to make informed decisions.

With growthepie, you can expect:

* **Detailed Metrics**: We provide comprehensive and up-to-date data on Layer 2 projects, including transaction count, number of active addresses, tvl, and more.
* **Blockspace Analytics**: The main metrics only tell so much, this is why we want to dig deeper and analyze how exactly different Layer 2s are used. E.g. are some L2s mainly for gaming or financial use-cases?&#x20;
* **Project Comparisons**: Easily compare Layer 2 projects and technologies side-by-side to understand their strengths and weaknesses.
* **Educational Resources**: Learn about Layer 2 technologies, their benefits, and how they fit into the broader Ethereum ecosystem through our educational content.

We invite you to explore growthepie and dive into the world of Ethereum Layer 2 projects. Whether you're an investor, developer, or just an enthusiast, our goal is to provide you with the knowledge and tools you need to succeed in this exciting and rapidly growing space. Welcome to the future of Ethereum scaling â€“ let's grow the pie together!
