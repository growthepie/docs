# ‚≠ê Value Locked

### Total Value Locked (TVL)

This metric was mainly coined by L2Beat. It measures the net bridged value to a Layer 2. Basically, the amount of value that is locked in L1 bridges to L2s. It also includes native tokens such as ARB and OP. We take this value directly from L2Beat.

### Stablecoin Market Cap

The amount of stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI, etc.) that are locked on a Layer 2.
