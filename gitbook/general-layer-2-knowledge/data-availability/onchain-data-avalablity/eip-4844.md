# üìÑ EIP 4844

It introduces a new transaction format, the "blob-carrying transactions", designed to slash gas fees :fuelpump: and supercharge scalability.

Take the Optimistic rollups as an example: &#x20;

1. They post compressed transaction data to Ethereum.
2. Then, they leave it for about 7 days, giving independent verifiers time to check things out.&#x20;
3. Spot an issue? Raise the alarm with a fraud-proof challenge! This makes the chain backtrack and ditch the dodgy block.

#### But here's the catch :fishing\_pole\_and\_fish: we talked about:&#x20;

this only works if the data's there to check. Right now, this data's stored forever on-chain (Ethereum L1) as CALLDATA, which makes it quite expensive. üì¶

However, with the upcoming EIP-4844, rollups can soon store their data in more budget-friendly blob storage. But, it's like a Snapchat for data ‚Äì it disappears after \~1-3 months! ‚è≥

During that short window, Ethereum's got your back, ensuring data's available. After that? It's up to the Ethereum community to keep things in check. Any node can double-check data using DAS (Data Availability Sampling), the solution to fraud-proof data availability problem!
