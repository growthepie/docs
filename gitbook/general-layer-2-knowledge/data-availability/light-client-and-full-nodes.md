# ⚪ Light/client and full nodes

## What’s the difference between light/client and full nodes?

### **Full nodes** 🖥️

Think of **Full nodes** 🖥️ like the super detail-oriented folks in the Web 3 world. They download everything and double-check it all. If they spot a block that doesn't add up (like when the block's final state doesn't match its transactions), they're quick to wave a red flag 🚩 with a fraud-proof, giving the light clients a heads-up.

### **Light clients** 💡

They're a bit more laid-back. They only grab block headers, skipping the nitty-gritty transaction details. But when they're curious about specific transactions or state bits, they'll ask their full node buddies for the scoop.
