# ðŸ“œ Data Availability

Polygon Mainnet's making moves to become a Validium, while Celo and Mantel are teaming up with @eigenlayer for their off-chain Data Availability. ðŸ”„ These are just a couple of the unique paths chains are exploring.

## What is not Data Availability?

It does not necessarily mean that the data is accessible forever. Data availability is the assurance that full nodes can access and verify the full set of transactions associated with a specific block. Thanks for the clarity, [Ethereum.org](http://ethereum.org/)! ðŸ‘“

## Ever heard of the data availability problem? ðŸ¤”

It's all about making sure that when we add a summary of transaction data to the blockchain, it's legit and represents real, valid transactions. We need to do this without making every node download all the data.

A good example is the case of [**Light nodes**](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/light-clients/) and [**Layer 2 rollups**](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/)**,** They need to be sure about data availability, but they don't want to download and process all the transaction data. That's their secret sauce! It's what keeps light nodes light and makes rollups a killer way to scale things up.
