# 🟢 Public Goods Network

## Introduction

### "The chain with purpose"

### What are public goods?

> **Anything that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous, that is, people can’t be barred access, and one person’s use doesn’t degrade another’s, the values of which are shared by the local public and is ultimately aimed at positive externalities that strive for the longer-term betterment of the whole world.**

This is a high-level description of what Toby Shorin, Laura Lotti, and Sam Hart shared about this topic in their post – Positive Sum Worlds.

### Sustainable Funding for Public Goods <a href="#id-840a" id="id-840a"></a>

One of the most remarkable features of the Public Goods Network is its commitment to generating sustainable funding for public goods initiatives. A substantial portion of transaction fees on PGN is earmarked to support various public goods projects. By running decentralized applications (dApps) on the PGN network, developers automatically contribute to funding these essential public goods, fostering an ecosystem of collective support and collaboration.

###

### Gitcoin's Role

PGN operates as a roll-up, managed collaboratively by [Gitcoin](https://www.gitcoin.co/) and [Conduit](https://conduit.xyz/), an independent infrastructure facilitator. It presents a unique approach to the distribution of sequencer fees. Rather than functioning for Gitcoin's benefit, it's geared towards those committed to creating enduring, credible, and substantial funding avenues for public initiatives. Read more about the sequencer fees of PGN $$->$$ [#technology](public-goods-network.md#technology "mention")

### Purpose

The core purpose of PGN is to serve as a digital convergence zone for individuals and entities dedicated to bolstering public goods.

#### Public Goods Alliance

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/The PG Alliance.gif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The Public Goods Alliance will be the governing and organizing body behind PGN. Anyone interested in building on PGN, receiving funding for public goods projects, or contributing to improving PGN is invited to participate.

#### How can I get involved as an alliance member?

You can reach out to PGN on Telegram via the “Alliance Discussion” channel. The requirements, commitments, and details are still forming. Expressing your interest helps PGN better shape this program. :point\_down:

## Technology

***

Check out our Page about OP Stack for a short summary of OP Stack :point\_down:

[op-stack.md](../op-stack.md "mention")

Public Goods Network also plans to integrate with Optimism Superchains.

If you do not know exactly what that is check out our short summary of that :point\_down:

[superchain.md](../superchain.md "mention")

### Why is Superchain desired?

* **Accelerate activity**
* **Be a part of the Public Goods Infrastructure**
* E**asier development**
* **Builds towards an interoperable crypto economy**

### Sequencer Fees

Most of the net sequencer fees are designated for public goods initiatives. Following the initial six months post-launch of PGN, these fees will undergo evaluation and distribution, drawing on comprehensive data accumulated during that period. Specific governance details are currently under development, and organizations are welcome to become part of the Network Alliance.

This collective will play a crucial role in shaping governance structures and deciding on the allocation of sequencer fees.

> Filling blockspace is, in part, a race to the bottom. The bottom of the stack is where value capture is the most persistent and accepted.

Rather than fill blockspace for other organizations who may be captured by VCs, or other rent-seeking motivations, PGN believes their blockspace should be filled such that they can reallocate those funds to further the objective of growing and funding public goods.

## Roadmap

### **Early 2024 Vision:**

#### Airdrop?

PGN is not planning an airdrop at this time but will explore how best to govern PGN in early 2024.

#### Non-Token-Related Governance

PGN is interested in finding non-token-related governance options but is still exploring what’s possible.

#### Contract Secured Revenue (CSR) \[No date announced yet]

In the future, PGN will enable CSR to support developers’ need for sustainable revenue sources.

> Contract Secured Revenue allows smart contract developers to claim a percentage of all transaction/gas fees paid by users when interacting with their smart contracts. This means that the more dApps that build on PGN and the more users that engage with those dApps, the more revenue that will be generated for both the developers deploying those dApps, and for Public Goods.

The following Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) proposes the introduction of CSR on EVM-based L2s (such as PGN) which would provide smart contract developers who deploy on L2s access to revenue streams and/or public goods.
