### **Optimistic Rollups (e.g. Arbitrum, Optimism)**:

* **Mechanism**: These rely on a system of fraud proofs. The rollup contract maintains a comprehensive history of state roots and the hash of each transaction batch.
* **Fraud Proofs**: If someone detects an incorrect post-state root in a batch, they can submit a fraud-proof to the blockchain. This proof demonstrates that the batch was computed incorrectly.
* **Verification and Reversion**: The contract verifies the fraud proof. If it finds the batch to be indeed incorrect, it reverts that batch and all subsequent batches, maintaining the integrity of the system.
* **Assumption of Honesty**: Optimistic Rollups operate under the assumption that all transactions are valid by default, and only in cases of fraud are proofs required and checked.

#### Transaction Fees Calculation

* Optimistic = (L1 data publishing gas \* L1 gas price) + (gas usage on L2 \* l2 gas price)



### **ZK-Rollups (e.g. zkSync Era, Ploygon zkEVM)**:

* **Mechanism**: These use validity proofs, specifically ZK-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge), to ensure the correctness of transactions.
* **Cryptographic Proofs**: Each batch includes a ZK-SNARK, which cryptographically proves that the post-state root is the correct outcome of executing the batch.
* **Efficient Verification**: Regardless of the size of the computation, the ZK-SNARK can be verified quickly on-chain, ensuring that only valid state changes are accepted.
* **Immediate Finality**: Unlike Optimistic Rollups, ZK Rollups provide immediate finality, as the validity of each batch is proven and verified before being accepted on the blockchain.

#### Transaction Fees Calculation

* Zero\_knowledge = ((L1 data publishing + L1 proof costs) \* L1 gas price) + (gas usage on L2 \* l2 gas price)

## Comparison and Outlook

> "In general, my own view is that in the short term, optimistic rollups are likely to win out for general-purpose EVM computation and ZK rollups are likely to win out for simple payments, exchange and other application-specific use cases, but in the medium to long term ZK rollups will win out in all use cases as ZK-SNARK technology improves."

#### Summary

**Optimistic Rollups**&#x20;

* Optimistic Rollups are more straightforward and closer to widespread adoption.
* Suitable for applications where immediate finality is less critical.
* Preferable for scenarios that require a simpler technological approach.
* Entail higher onchain gas costs.
* Feature a longer withdrawal period.



**ZK Rollups**

* Offer immediate transaction finality.
* Provide lower per-transaction gas costs, ideal for high-volume, fast-paced environments.
* Complexity and higher off-chain computation costs are notable trade-offs.
* More challenging to generalize for broad applications.
* Rapidly evolving technology.
