### **Optimistic Rollups (e.g. Arbitrum, Optimism)**:

* **Mechanism**: These rely on a system of fraud proofs. The rollup contract maintains a comprehensive history of state roots and the hash of each transaction batch.
* **Fraud Proofs**: If someone detects an incorrect post-state root in a batch, they can submit a fraud-proof to the blockchain. This proof demonstrates that the batch was computed incorrectly.
* **Verification and Reversion**: The contract verifies the fraud proof. If it finds the batch to be indeed incorrect, it reverts that batch and all subsequent batches, maintaining the integrity of the system.
* **Assumption of Honesty**: Optimistic Rollups operate under the assumption that all transactions are valid by default, and only in cases of fraud are proofs required and checked.

#### Transaction Fees Calculation

* Optimistic = (L1 data publishing gas \* L1 gas price) + (gas usage on L2 \* l2 gas price)



### **ZK-Rollups (e.g. zkSync Era, Ploygon zkEVM)**:

* **Mechanism**: These use validity proofs, specifically ZK-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge), to ensure the correctness of transactions.
* **Cryptographic Proofs**: Each batch includes a ZK-SNARK, which cryptographically proves that the post-state root is the correct outcome of executing the batch.
* **Efficient Verification**: Regardless of the size of the computation, the ZK-SNARK can be verified quickly on-chain, ensuring that only valid state changes are accepted.
* **Immediate Finality**: Unlike Optimistic Rollups, ZK Rollups provide immediate finality, as the validity of each batch is proven and verified before being accepted on the blockchain.

#### Transaction Fees Calculation

* Zero\_knowledge = ((L1 data publishing + L1 proof costs) \* L1 gas price) + (gas usage on L2 \* l2 gas price)

## Comparison and Outlook

> "In general, my own view is that in the short term, optimistic rollups are likely to win out for general-purpose EVM computation and ZK rollups are likely to win out for simple payments, exchange and other application-specific use cases, but in the medium to long term ZK rollups will win out in all use cases as ZK-SNARK technology improves."

## Scenario ðŸŒŸ

Imagine you're a developer working on two different blockchain projects: a decentralized marketplace (Project A) and a high-frequency trading platform (Project B). You're considering using Layer 2 solutions to optimize transaction efficiency and cost, and you're torn between Optimistic Rollups and ZK Rollups. Understanding the differences in their costs and functionalities is crucial for your decision.

### **Project A: Decentralized Marketplace - Optimistic Rollups**

* **Nature of Project**: This marketplace involves various transactions like listing items, bidding, and final sales. Immediate finality of transactions is not critical, as there's usually a waiting period for bids and sales to conclude.
* **Why Optimistic Rollups?**:
  * **Simplicity**: Optimistic Rollups are straightforward and align with the marketplace's less complex transaction structure.
  * **Adoption Readiness**: They are closer to widespread adoption, offering a more stable and tested environment.
  * **Cost Consideration**: While they entail higher on-chain gas costs, the frequency of transactions in a marketplace (not too high) makes this a manageable expense.
  * **Withdrawal Period**: The longer withdrawal period is not a significant concern, as marketplace transactions don't demand immediate finality.

### **Project B: High-Frequency Trading Platform - ZK Rollups**

* **Nature of Project**: This platform requires rapid transaction processing due to the high volume and fast pace of trades.
* **Why ZK Rollups?**:
  * **Immediate Finality**: ZK Rollups offer instant transaction finality, crucial for the dynamic nature of trading.
  * **Lower Gas Costs**: They provide lower per-transaction gas costs, a significant advantage given the high volume of trades.
  * **Complexity Trade-off**: The complexity and higher off-chain computation costs are acceptable trade-offs for the efficiency gains in a trading environment.
  * **Generalization Challenge**: While more challenging to generalize, the specific nature of high-frequency trading fits well with the capabilities of ZK Rollups.

## **Key Differences**

* **Cost Efficiency**: For Project A (marketplace), the higher on-chain gas costs of Optimistic Rollups are offset by the lower frequency of transactions. In contrast, Project B (trading platform) benefits from the lower per-transaction costs of ZK Rollups due to its high transaction volume.
* **Transaction Finality**: The marketplace can afford the longer finality period of Optimistic Rollups, whereas the trading platform benefits from the immediate finality provided by ZK Rollups.
* **Technical Complexity**: Optimistic Rollups' simpler technology aligns with the marketplace's needs, while the trading platform can leverage the advanced technology of ZK Rollups despite its complexity.

## Summary

### Optimistic Rollups

* More straightforward and closer to widespread adoption.&#x20;
* Suitable for applications where immediate finality is less critical.
* Preferable for scenarios that require a simpler technological approach.
* Entail higher onchain gas costs. Feature a longer withdrawal period.

### ZK Rollups&#x20;

* Offer immediate transaction finality.
* Provide lower per-transaction gas costs, ideal for high-volume, fast-paced environments.&#x20;
* Complexity and higher off-chain computation costs are notable trade-offs.&#x20;
* More challenging to generalize for broad applications.&#x20;
* Rapidly evolving technology.
