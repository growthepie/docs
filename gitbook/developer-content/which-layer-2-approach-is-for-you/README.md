  Here we will paint an overview of Layer 2s for developers deciding to build
  their own chains, scale Ethereum, or make a transition to Layer 2.

# ⚖ Which Layer 2 approach is for you?



### Why do you need to consider this?🤔



Different applications need different levels of security, decentralization, or scalability. Based on their demands there are at the moment different approaches to moving into blockchain-based platforms. 🌐

#### Take non-financial platforms such as gaming 🎮 or social media 📱, for instance:

These realms thrive on decentralization, yet their security needs are not one-size-fits-all. Consider the diverse facets of a social media app:&#x20;

* Critical functions like registering usernames 🔐 and recovering accounts demand robust security, ideally managed through a rollup.
* On the other hand, everyday actions like posting 💬 or voting 👍 can afford a lighter security touch.

#### Why?&#x20;

Because the stakes are different. If a glitch in the chain makes a post vanish, it's a minor hiccup 😕.

But if the same glitch locks you out of your account, it's a crisis 🚨.&#x20;

This nuanced approach to security ensures that each aspect of the app receives the attention it deserves, balancing efficiency with safety.



### What to expect?



We will discuss each Layer 2 solution that exists with examples and ups and downs and guide you to more in-depth resources regarding each of them 📚.

We will have a special focus on transaction cost 💰, and the applications of each of these Layer 2 options, to help you with your decision-making 🤝.
