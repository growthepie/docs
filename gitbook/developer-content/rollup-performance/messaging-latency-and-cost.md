# ðŸ“¨ Messaging Latency and Cost

### **Messaging**

* The Rollup allows for seamless communication with Layer 1, enabling the transmission of arbitrary messages.
* Each protocol ensures the verifiable transfer of data to the intended chain.

**Latency from L1 to L2**:

* This refers to the duration required for a message to become accessible on the Rollup once it's included in an Ethereum block.

**Cost from L1 to L2**:

* The expense involved in sending a message from Ethereum to the Layer 2 Rollup.
* The Rollup processes the message using a system address, acting on behalf of the original sender from Layer 1.
* The sender on Layer 1 bears the cost of Layer 2 gas for message execution.

**Latency from L2 to L1**:

* This is the time taken for a message to be available on Ethereum after itâ€™s recorded in a Rollup block and sequenced to Layer 1.

**Cost from L2 to L1**:

* The gas expense incurred for the verification and initiation of message execution on Ethereum, following its dispatch from the Rollup.
* This cost is covered by the Externally Owned Account (EOA) that triggers the claim transaction on Layer 1.
* It's important to note that this cost does not include the expenses arising from the operations performed as a result of the message.
